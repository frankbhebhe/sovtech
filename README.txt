# sovtech website

# Used Astra theme as my main theme and created a child theme called Sovtech for all my custom code. ( I use child theme because if a theme updates you will lose all your custom code so to avoid this you add all your code in the child theme that will never update on its own )

# I used elementor builder because it is light and loads a bit faster on websites, also with elementor you can do a lot of things without using any plugins which is best for website perfomance.

# I added a custom post type on the dashboard called Sovtechvacancies which is one of the main things a developer should know how to do.

# I used yoast for SEO optimisation adding Focus keyphrase, Slug and Meta description.

# All my images have Alt tags and titles for SEO.

# SEO score for the page on Lighthouse is 97%.

# Padding on my columns is 30px and my theme color code is #1E83EC.

# My php version is 7.4

# Memory limit 256mb to support all the elements used.

# Wordpress version 6.0.1 Latest version.

# All plugins are up to date for the website security.

## Mobile responsive.
